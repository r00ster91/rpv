# RPV (role-playing Viridian)

A small proof of concept of an 8-direction "RPG" featuring Viridian from [VVVVVV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/).
It's just a really small demo, not an RPG by itself.

This uses raylib but I initially tried sokol which I evaluated as not very suitable for this project.
You will probably need to [build raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux#building-library).
